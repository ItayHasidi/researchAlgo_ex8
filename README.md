# Research Algorithms - ex8

An implementation of the eleven algorithms that appear in the paper [Two-player fair division of indivisible items: Comparison of algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221718304764).

## The algorithms:
### Sequential:
  a.k.a OS. The algorithm returns envy-free allocations if they exist, does not return max-min allocation and returns
    one Pareto optimality allocation.
 ### Restricted simple:
 a.k.a RS. The algorithm does not return envy-free allocations, does not return max-min allocations and does not
    return one Pareto optimality allocations.
 ### Singles Doubles:
  a.k.a SD. The algorithm returns envy-free allocations, returns max-min allocations and returns one Pareto
    optimality allocations.
 ### Iterated singles doubles:
 a.k.a IS. The algorithm returns envy-free allocations, returns max-min allocations and returns one Pareto
    optimality allocations.
### S1:
The algorithm returns envy-free allocations if they exist and returns max-min allocations.
### L1:
The algorithm returns envy-free allocations if they exist and returns max-min allocations.
### Top down:
a.k.a TD. The algorithm does not return envy-free allocations and returns max-min allocations.
### Top down alternating:
a.k.a TA. The algorithm does not return envy-free allocations and returns max-min allocations.
### Bottom up:
a.k.a BU. The algorithm does not return envy-free allocations and does not return max-min allocations.
### Bottom up alternating:
a.k.a BA. The algorithm does not return envy-free allocations and does not return max-min allocations.
### Trump:
a.k.a TR. The algorithm returns envy-free allocations, does not return max-min allocations and returns one Pareto
    optimality allocations.
